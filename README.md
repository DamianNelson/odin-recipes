# odin-recipes

In this project, I will build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a 
few recipes. It won't look very pretty, unless you're really into 
brutalist web design..

This project is just to build my HTML chops; it will be revisited in the 
future to style it up with CSS.
