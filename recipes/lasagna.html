    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Recipe taken from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19344/homemade-lasagna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homemade-Lasagna</a> from <a href="http://www.allrecipes.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allrecipes.com</a></p>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and a crusty garlic bread</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Meat</em>: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat(1/2 pound ground pork, 1/2 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li><em>Onion</em>: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat</li>
        <li><em>Canned Tomatoes</em>: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li><em>Fresh Herbs</em>: For fresh flavor, chop two tablesppons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic </li>
        <li><em>Sugar</em>: A dash of sugar balances out all the acidity from the tomatoes </li>
        <li><em>Spices and seasonings</em>: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt and black pepper. </li>
        <li><em>Noodles</em>: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time. </li>
        <li><em>Cheese</em>: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li><em>Eggs</em>: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together). </li>
    </ul>
